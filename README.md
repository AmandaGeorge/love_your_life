# Love Your Life Application
Everybody likes a LYL pick-me-up

What is it?
-----------
Love Your Life is a website where you can post random acts of kindness that happened to you or that you did for others. Or just something great that happened to you. Even if you log in, posts won't show your name. This isn't about who did what. This is about sharing the good and beautiful things that happen in our world just for the sake of putting good things out there. Hopefully you'll even get ideas for more ways to spread kindness. 


In the spirit of "Say something nice, or don't say anything at all," you can vote up posts, but you can't vote them down. The ability to comment on posts is purposely not included. We've all seen how commenting can bring out the worst in people, and we don't need that on this site.
